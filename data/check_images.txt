Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG classified Dog_01.jpg as a Labrador Retriever, while AlexNet classified it as a Golden Retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three model architectures classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed. However, the specific breed identified differed between models.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: ResNet correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not dogs. AlexNet misclassified Animal_Name_01.jpg as a dog, while VGG correctly identified both as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I selected VGG as the best model architecture for classifying the four uploaded images. VGG consistently identified the breeds of the dog images correctly and did not misclassify any non-dog images, demonstrating the most accurate performance overall.
